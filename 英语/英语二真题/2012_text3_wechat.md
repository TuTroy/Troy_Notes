>文章围绕“基因专利”展开，通过引入Myriad案件展开论述，一二段说明联邦上诉法院对Myriad案件做出裁决(刚开始取消专利，然后恢复专利)。第三四段表明法院并没有停下来而是更忙碌，说明案件将延伸到整个行业，将是一场持久战。第五六段表示Myriad案件已经联系到了整个生物科技行业，各公司寻找新方向“connecting dots”找到各个基因之间的相关联，并申请专利，说明基因战一时半会还难以结束--也就是公司寻找新的专利对抗联邦法院的围剿。

Para 1 

①In 2010, a federal judge shook America’s biotech industry to its core. ②Companies had won patents for isolated DNA for decades—by 2005 some 20% of human genes were patented. ③But in March 2010 a judge ruled that genes were unpatentable. ④Executives were violently agitated. ⑤The Biotechnology Industry Organisation (BIO), a trade group, assured members that this was just a “preliminary step” in a longer battle.

para 2

①On July 29th they were relieved, at least temporarily. ②A federal appeals court overturned the prior decision, ruling that Myriad Genetics could indeed hold patents to two genes that help forecast a woman’s risk of breast cancer. ③The chief executive of Myriad, a company in Utah, said the ruling was a blessing to firms and patients alike.

para 3

①But as companies continue their attempts at personalised medicine, the courts will remain rather busy. ②The Myriad case itself is probably not over. ③Critics make three main arguments against gene patents: a gene is a product of nature, so it may not be patented; gene patents suppress innovation rather than reward it; and patents’ monopolies restrict access to genetic tests such as Myriad’s. ④A growing number seem to agree. ⑤Last year a federal task-force urged reform for patents related to genetic tests. ⑥In October the Department of Justice filed a brief in the Myriad case, arguing that an isolated DNA molecule “is no less a product of nature... than are cotton fibres that have been separated from cotton seeds”.

①Despite the appeals court’s decision, big questions remain unanswered. ②For example, it is unclear whether the sequencing of a whole genome violates the patents of individual genes within it. ③The case may yet reach the Supreme Court.

①As the industry advances, however, other suits may have an even greater impact. ②Companies are unlikely to file many more patents for human DNA molecules—most are already patented or in the public domain. ③Firms are now studying how genes interact, looking for correlations that might be used to determine the causes of disease or predict a drug’s efficacy. ④Companies are eager to win patents for “connecting the dots”, explains Hans Sauer, a lawyer for the BIO.

文章整体的行为还是很清晰的，从引入案例来引出基因专利的话题，又围绕行业是如何应对和联邦法院的限制进行描述，下面对逐段分析文章。

### Para 1

①In 2010, a federal judge shook America’s biotech industry to its core. ②Companies had won patents for isolated DNA for decades—by 2005 some 20% of human genes were patented. ③But in March 2010 a judge ruled that genes were unpatentable. ④Executives were violently agitated. ⑤The Biotechnology Industry Organisation (BIO), a trade group, assured members that this was just a “preliminary step” in a longer battle.

- 生词：

isolate v. 分离

agitated adj.  紧张不安的

preliminary adj.  初步的

assure(to tell sb that sth is definitely true or is definitely going to happen, especially when they have doubts about it)


- 词组

shake ... to its core 使...彻底震撼

to its core = extremely and completely

win patents for 获取关于...的专利


- 段落分析

首先引出悬念，联邦法官到底做了什么震撼了生物科技产业，转笔描述行业之前情况，截止2005年大约20%的人类基因被公司申请了专利。进一步描述现状，也照应第一句，基因将不能被申请专利，通过今昔对比，以及对裁决的震撼，表明了这是对行业是个大事件。行业各个公司的主极度管焦虑不安，连行业协会BIO都出面向成员(也就是哪些公司)保证说这只是持久战的开始。


### Para 2

①On July 29th they were relieved, at least temporarily. ②A federal appeals court overturned the prior decision, ruling that Myriad Genetics could indeed hold patents to two genes that help forecast a woman’s risk of breast cancer. ③The chief executive of Myriad, a company in Utah, said the ruling was a blessing to firms and patients alike.

- 生词

relieve v. 缓和，减轻

rule v. 裁决

alike adv. 同样都

appeal v. 上诉

-  词组

hold patents to 持有...的专利

a blessing to ...的福音

- 段落分析

这一段是转接上一段，紧张的气氛也变得舒适。这里的they were relieved的they表示companies,BIO,excetives。因为联邦上诉法庭推翻了之前的判决，确保了Myriad的专利权，这个公司的老总也就坡下滚，说这对公司和病人都好。


### Para 3

①But as companies continue their attempts at personalised medicine, the courts will remain rather busy. ②The Myriad case itself is probably not over. ③Critics make three main arguments against gene patents: a gene is a product of nature, so it may not be patented; gene patents suppress innovation rather than reward it; and patents’ monopolies restrict access to genetic tests such as Myriad’s. ④A growing number seem to agree. ⑤Last year a federal task-force urged reform for patents related to genetic tests. ⑥In October the Department of Justice filed a brief in the Myriad case, arguing that an isolated DNA molecule “is no less a product of nature... than are cotton fibres that have been separated from cotton seeds”.

- 生词

rather adv. 特别

suppress v. 抑制

task-force n. 专项小组

fibres n. 纤维素

- 词组

not over 并没有结束

one's attempts at 对...的尝试

suppress innovation 抑制创新

restrict access to 限制了对...的使用

file a brief 提交案情摘要

no less than ... 和...一样

- 段落分析

as ... 表示说明原因,科技公司从事私人化医疗-这些以个人基因组的信息为基础，这样会涉及到各个专利问题，这也是为什么法院会更忙。The Myriad case itself is probably not over. 上一段说法院推翻之前的裁决，允许Myriad拥有专利，但是这里说这件事没完，进而引出反对者的观点，itself表示强调。反对者有三个反对点：1.基因是自然产品而不是人造的; 2.基因专利会抑制创新; 3.会造成垄断，限制别人测试; 而且越来越多的人认同这几点。最后两句以特别小组和司法部的行动来论证这些观点。联邦特别小组论证了2,3点，并且催促改革。司法部也通过举例棉纤维从棉种子里面提取出来，是自然产物来表明对基因的论证。



### Para 4

①Despite the appeals court’s decision, big questions remain unanswered. ②For example, it is unclear whether the sequencing of a whole genome violates the patents of individual genes within it. ③The case may yet reach the Supreme Court.



- 生词

sequence v.  to identify the order in which a set of [genes](eudic-https://cn.eudic.net/dict/searchword?word=genes#ID1344212299) or parts of [molecules](eudic-https://cn.eudic.net/dict/searchword?word=molecules#ID1344212299) are arranged 测定（整套基因或分子成分的）序列

genome n. 基因组



- 词组

violate the patent of  违反...的基因

- 句子分析

For example, it is unclear whether the sequencing of a whole genome violates the patents of individual genes within it.

例如，尚不明确对这个基因组对排序是否会违反里面单个基因的专利



- 段落分析

这段是对上一段的继续论证，照应了Myriad案件 not over，也是对反对三点的补充，还有很多问题并没有解决，所以这个案件可能会递交给最高法院。



### Para 5

①As the industry advances, however, other suits may have an even greater impact. ②Companies are unlikely to file many more patents for human DNA molecules—most are already patented or in the public domain. ③Firms are now studying how genes interact, looking for correlations that might be used to determine the causes of disease or predict a drug’s efficacy. ④Companies are eager to win patents for “connecting the dots”, explains Hans Sauer, a lawyer for the BIO.



- 生词

advance v. 发展

molecule n. 分子

interact v. 互动

correlation n. 关联物

- 词组

file a patent for 就...提交专利申请

a drug's efficacy 药物药效



- 长难句

Firms are now studying how genes interact, looking for correlations that might be used to determine the causes of disease or predict a drug’s efficacy. 

各企业正在研究基因间如何相互作用，寻求可能用于疾病诱因和预测药物疗效的关联物。



- 段落分析

从一个案件正式引入到整个行业，点明以后的案件会越来越复杂，影响也会越大。公司的战略也会发生改变，从之前申请已有的和公共领域存在的基因专利，到研究基因间的相互作用。都想通过连点来抢占更多的专利权，从而点出了公司之间的专利战将是一场持久战。



### Para 6

①Their success may be determined by a suit related to this issue, brought by the Mayo Clinic, which the Supreme Court will hear in its next term. ②The BIO recently held a convention which included sessions to coach lawyers on the shifting landscape for patents. ③Each meeting was packed.



- 生词

convention n. 会议

session n. 一系列会议中的一场会议

packed adj. 挤满人的

- 词组

shifting landscape 变化的形势

coach sb. on sth. 就谋事对某人进行培训

Each meeting was packed. 每场会议都座无虚席



- 段落分析

这里引入了一个新的案件Mayo案件，this issue--就是能否就连点基因获取专利。后面的BIO一系列的会议以及每场会议都座无虚席表明了对这个案件的重视程度。
